This repository hosts my professional portfolio, built with a focus on modern automation performance and seamless CI/CD integration. As a DevOps Engineer, I treat my personal site like any production-grade application: automated, scalable, and version-controlled.

## Technical Stack

* **Framework:** [Node.js / Next.js] (Tailwind CSS for styling)
* **Deployment:** Vercel (Edge Network)
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions / Vercel Git Integration
* **Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics & Speed Insights

## DevOps Philosophy Applied

Even for a static portfolio, I implement core DevOps practices:

1.  **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Every merge to `main` triggers an automated build and atomic deployment via Vercel.
2.  **Environment Parity:** Using Vercel Preview Deployments to test UI changes in a staging environment before promoting to production.
3.  **Automated Quality Gates:** ESLint and Prettier checks integrated into the git workflow to ensure code consistency.
4.  **Performance Optimization:** Leveraging Vercel’s Edge Network and Image Optimization to ensure <1s load times globally.
